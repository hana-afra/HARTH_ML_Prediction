# Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning

## Abstract

The field of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques. The Human Activity Recognition Trondheim (HARTH) dataset is a valuable resource that provides extensive data for developing and testing such algorithms. Collected from 22 participants, each wearing two 3-axial accelerometers on their right thigh and lower back, the dataset includes over six million instances of various annotated activities performed in a free-living environment. These activities range from basic movements like walking and running to more complex actions such as cycling and climbing stairs.

This project aims to leverage the HARTH dataset to perform a comparative analysis of multiple machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree Learning, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Each of these algorithms offers unique strengths and capabilities, making them suitable for different aspects of activity recognition.

The core objective is to assess the performance of these algorithms in accurately classifying human activities based on accelerometer data. This involves extensive preprocessing of the raw time-series data, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By conducting this comparative analysis, the project seeks to identify the most effective machine learning approach for precise and reliable human activity recognition.

The insights gained from this study can inform future research and development in HAR systems, contributing to applications in health monitoring, sports analytics, and smart environments. The findings will highlight the relative advantages and limitations of each algorithm, providing a comprehensive understanding of their applicability in real-world HAR scenarios.
